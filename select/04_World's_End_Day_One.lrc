[00:55.07] Remember how you made me feel
[01:01.68] I can't believe it seemed so real
[01:09.18] So now i find that you are gone
[01:15.50] I've lost the strength to carry on
[01:50.13] The ground below or skies above
[01:56.57] I still don't know if I am right
[02:03.86] But I know that for your love
[02:07.46] (Love, love, love)
[02:10.21] I'll go to wold's end tonight
